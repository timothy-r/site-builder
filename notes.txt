* How to add leaf page contents to the index yaml files?
* Build a node tree with all the data for writing to the index.yml files,
    implementing depth first traversal of the soure files
    so that the process reads the leaf page data for a node being processed in the tree
    currently each source page is read independently, so there is the need to be able to
    identify the item in the index.yml file, written previously, to update

* Node tree works in all processes
    * html to html, html to yml, yml to html
    * the processes treat html files as a source of data & links between files
